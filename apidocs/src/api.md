# Conjur Community Edition API

This is official documentation of the Conjur Community Edition API. It
allows you tremendous flexibility to control and manipulate your
Conjur software.

# Group User authentication

Most API calls require an authentication access token. To obtain an access token as a user:

1. Use a username and password to obtain an API key (refresh token) with the [Authentication > Login](#user-authentication-login) route.
2. Use the API key to obtain an access token with the [Authentication > Authenticate](#user-authentication-authenticate) route.

Access tokens expire after 8 minutes. You need to obtain a new token after it expires.
Token expiration and renewal is handled automatically by the
Conjur [CLI](https://developer.conjur.net/cli) and [client libraries](https://developer.conjur.net/clients).

## SSL verification

Use the public key you obtained when running `conjur init` for SSL verification when talking to your Conjur endpoint.
This is a *public* key, so you can check it into source control if needed.

For example, with curl:

```
$ curl --cacert <certfile> ...
```
